Purpose: Not so much a purpose to this rather I was playing around with Yahoo Finance's stock info api's and I thought this would be fun to make. 

Skills learned:
- Using API's, matplotlib, pandas, and Spacy's NLP library

Create's candlestick chart based on natural language input. Ensure company names are capitalized (you do not need to input stock ticker). All dates and times should be in the format 'mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.' For example "Please make me a chart for the company Amazon from the date 04/27/2024 at 13:30 am to the date 05/02/2024 at the time 19:59 pm with 1 minute intervals"

Example output with that sentence:
